## Introduction

Next.js recently became the official React framework as outlined in React docs.
In this project i'm trying to cover all the most important features and concepts.

# In this project, i'm covering the following topics:

- Next.js 13 App Folder Structure
- Next.js 13 Client Components vs Server Components
- Next.js 13 File-based Routing (including dynamic and nested routes)
- Next.js 13 page, layout, loading, and error Special Files
- Next.js 13 Serverless Route Handlers (Next API, Full Stack Apps)
- Next.js 13 Metadata and Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

# Frontend 

- For sure it will be React.js function component.
- Typescript.
- TailwindCss

# Backend 

- Node.js and MongoDb with mongoose.
- Typescript.

## Project keys: 

- Fully structured Next.js application. 
- Fully authentication process using GOOGLE provider. 
- CRUD operation on how to create, edit , update and delete portfolio projects. 
- Landing on TailwindCss and building amazing user interface.  

## Getting Started


- First you need the follwing keys to be in your .env file: 

1- Google cloud console. 
2- Mongodb collection. 
3- Vercel as our deployment server.


Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
